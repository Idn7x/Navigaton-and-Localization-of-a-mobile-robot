# Navigation-and-Localization-of-a-mobile-robot
Our project is an intelligent mobile robot system, Able to perform a simple tasks in  real-world environment. 

<h2 align="center">Project description:</h2>

* Our project is an intelligent mobile robot system, Able to perform a simple tasks in real-world environment. 

* This robot will navigate in indoor environment (Known environment) using a simple technique of localization.

* With regard to mapping, the map will be already generated because the environment (workspace) where the robot will navigate is already known.

<h2 align="center">The inspired idea:</h2>

Our idea inspired by the kiva robot system of Amazon; what does the kiva robot do?? .
When an order is entered into the Kiva database system, the software locates the 
closest automated guided vehicle (bot) to the item and directs it to retrieve it. The 
mobile robots navigate around the warehouse (Known environment) by following a 
series of computerized bar-code stickers on the floor (Simple technique of 
localization)

This is a link of a video about the Kiva system robot of Amazon : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzjTr9FspbU&ab_channel=FastCompany

<h2 align="center">Localization Technique:</h2>
Our mobile robot will be largely similar to the kiva system robot, But we will use another technique of localization (not the bar-code stickers) that is Line tracking 
Localization Technique (Suivi de ligne) and the workspace will be mapped using the Cartesian coordinates,


<h2 align="center">Cognition (Tasks planning ):</h2>
With regard to the cognition (the task planning) will be based on the calculation of the blockCity distance which is also known as Manhattan distance,

<h2 align="center">Plan:</h2>
We constructed our robot by following the next stages in order :

* Mechanical design .
* Electronic components.
* Localization and Navigation techniques.
* Wireless communication taking into account the security aspect.
* Graphical user interface (GUI) using LabView/Matlab.
