Our project is an intelligent mobile robot system, Able to perform a simple tasks in 
real-world environment. 

This robot will navigate in indoor environment (Known environment) using a simple 
technique of localization.

With regard to mapping, the map will be already generated because the environment 
(workspace) where the robot will navigate is already known.


* Manage directory services and authentication.

The task is to build a network divided into two subnets with:

* One DHCP server responsible for delivering addresses to devices connected on both subnets.
* Managing the domain names will be handled by the DNS server.
* The FTP server is used to share files in only one subnet (users on the other subnet
are not allowed to access this service).
* An HTTP server managing two web pages. One is accessible to all hosts, and one
with restricted access (user-password).
* A server managing the email exchange in the company.
* LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is used for directory services and
authentication.
